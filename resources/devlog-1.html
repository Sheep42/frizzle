<p>I wanted to post an update here for anyone who's downloaded the game and is interested in following its development.</p>
<p>First -&nbsp;Thank you! The reception to this little game was better than we expected, and we hope you've enjoyed playing.</p>
<p>Frizzle has officially been approved for the Catalog, and we have a release date set for early September! The game will be available there for $1, and we plan on keeping it available here on Itch as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Leading up to the Catalog release there was some player feedback that I wanted to address, and just some general housekeeping that I wanted to work on. That's been done as part of this update. For more information, you can read below, but know there are some spoilers for the gameplay.</p>

<summary>Update 1.1.0: Spoilers Ahead</summary>
<p>I've had enough players tell me the end-game system crash, after you decide to stop Frizzle or not, is confusing that I have decided that it needed to go before the official release on the Catalog.</p>
<p>In this update, the crash will be replaced with a manufactured crash screen that doesn't break the immersion by making you manually restart the console and re-enter the game.</p>
<p>All Updates v1.1.0:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Updated data saving/loading system for seamless updates</li>
    <li>Replaced actual end-game crash with fake crash</li>
    <li>Fixed a timer bug that can occasionally cause a softlock during the final scenes</li>
</ul>
