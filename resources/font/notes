Frizzle: Futura Handwritten - By Billy Snyder

Note of the author
Futura Handwritten follows the BASIC shape structure of one of my personal favorite fonts, Futura Medium, but in a fun looking, handwritten style. Great for comics and other cartoons. I actually use this font for a webcomic that I created(www.pixelfailure.com), if you want to see it in action. :D

Feel free to use this font for anything you want. Crediting me would be absolutely wonderful, but I can't expect everyone to do it, so it isn't required.

If anything, at least send me a copy of the work when you use it. I love seeing my fonts in action. :)
